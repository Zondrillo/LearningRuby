I'm trying to create a way to have users comment on my posts. Currently I have All user posts showing up on my home page and then in the user profile only the current users posts. I would like to have it so that the comments appear only on the posts in the users profile. I tried to add a comment form in the user profile but I got an undefined method `comments' for nil:NilClass error.
